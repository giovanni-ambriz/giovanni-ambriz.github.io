        <h1>Identity, Values and Strenghts</h1>
        <h2>Making ethical decisions</h2>
        <p>
          While working at a hostel, a guest failed to show up for their
          reservation due to a car accident. The reservation was non-refundable,
          and according to the hostel's policy, the full amount was to be
          charged for no-shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this scenario, the values of empathy, compassion, and flexibility
          were crucial. It's essential to recognize the human aspect of the
          situation and the unexpected challenges the guest faced
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite not having immediate approval from a manager, you decided to
          waive the cancellation fee for the guest. Your decision stemmed from
          your belief in being flexible and understanding in extraordinary
          circumstances, even if it meant going against company policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back on the decision, you realize that it was aligned with
          your personal values of empathy and compassion. While it may have
          deviated from the company policy, you believe it was the right thing
          to do considering the circumstances. The experience reinforced the
          importance of balancing company guidelines with human empathy,
          especially in situations where guests encounter unforeseen
          difficulties.
        </p>
        <h2>My background and its influence in my identity</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up in Mexico has profoundly shaped my values and identity. The
          vibrant culture, rich traditions, and close-knit community have all
          played significant roles in shaping who I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mexican culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. From
          a young age, I was taught the importance of family bonds, respect for
          others, and the value of spending quality time together. My culture is
          known for its warmth, hospitality, and emphasis on relationships.
          Whether it's sharing a meal with loved ones, celebrating festivals and
          holidays, or participating in community gatherings, these experiences
          have taught me the importance of building meaningful connections and
          supporting one another through both joyous and challenging times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people around me, including family members, friends, and mentors,
          have also played a pivotal role in shaping my values and identity.
          Through their guidance, wisdom, and encouragement, I have learned the
          importance of hard work, perseverance, and resilience. They have
          instilled in me a sense of pride in my heritage and a desire to
          contribute positively to my community and society at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I have been able to live in other countries in the world
          where I have been influenced by other cultures and customs. This
          multicultural environment has fostered a deep appreciation for
          diversity and inclusion, encouraging me to embrace different
          viewpoints and celebrate the richness of our collective heritage.
        </p>
        <h2>Strengths and my learning journey</h2>
        <p>
          My strengths of honesty, commitment, and perseverance will be
          invaluable assets during my learning journey. They enable me to
          approach my studies with integrity, dedication, and resilience,
          ensuring that I tackle challenges authentically and persistently
          pursue my academic goals. With these strengths as my guide, I am
          confident in my ability to navigate the learning process effectively
          and achieve success.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations in my learning journey</h2>
        <p>
          I acknowledge that time management has been an area where I struggle
          at times. Balancing academic responsibilities, personal commitments,
          and a full-time job can be challenging, and I sometimes find myself
          overwhelmed by competing priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, while I possess strong interpersonal skills, I tend to be
          more introverted, which can sometimes hinder my ability to network
          effectively or assert myself in group settings. This may limit
          opportunities for collaboration and professional advancement,
          particularly in environments that prioritize extroverted qualities.
        </p>
        <h2>Working productively with others and its difficulties</h2>
        <p>
          While working at a hostel, I was part of a team responsible for
          managing guest services and ensuring a pleasant stay for visitors. One
          busy weekend, we encountered tension among staff members regarding the
          distribution of workload during busy hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address the tension, I made team meetings to discuss workload
          distribution and find solutions together. We brainstormed ideas to
          streamline tasks and redistribute responsibilities based on each team
          member's strengths and availability. Also, I encouraged open
          communication for the team members to express their concerns and
          suggest improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the team meetings and open communication channels helped to some
          extent, there were still instances of resistance and frustration among
          staff members. Some team members felt overwhelmed with their workload,
          while others believed that certain tasks were unfairly distributed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the situation, I realized that a more structured
          approach to task delegation and regular check-ins could have been
          beneficial. In the future, I would implement a rotating schedule to
          ensure fair distribution of tasks among team members and reduce the
          likelihood of burnout. I would also conduct regular performance
          reviews to identify areas for improvement and provide support and
          training where needed.
