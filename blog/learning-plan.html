        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>Long term goal or career pathway</h2>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to become a proficient full-stack web developer
          and eventually lead web development projects in a company.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aim to specialize in front-end development initially, mastering
          technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then gradually expand
          my skills to back-end development frameworks. However, my direction
          could change once I step into the industry and have a wider knowledge
          of all the different paths that can be followed.
        </p>
        <h2>My strengths and limitations in learning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Strengths: I possess strong problem-solving skills, attention to
            detail, and a passion for learning new skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limitations: I sometimes struggle with time management and may need
            additional support in understanding complex technical concepts./li>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          Non-Technical Core/Human Skills Development to acquire during the
          course
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Communication: Improve my ability to transmit technical concepts
            clearly to both technical and non-technical environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaboration: Improve my teamwork skills by actively participating
            in group projects and seeking feedback from others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adaptability: Embrace challenges and changes in technology trends by
            continuously seeking new learning opportunities and staying updated
            with industry best practices.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Commitment to workloadâ€™s management</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Develop a detailed study schedule that allocates time for lectures,
            assignments, part time job and personal commitments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of productivity tools such as Toggl track, and calendar
            reminders to stay organized and prioritize tasks effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regularly assess progress and adjust the schedule as needed to make
            sure that things do not build up on me, and if they do, replan and
            prioritize my time in activities that need to be completed
            immediately.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Commitment to seek help</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Recognize when a topic becomes difficult despite using my available
            tools and resources to resolve an issue. Reach out to the help desk
            before investing significant time in attempting to find a solution
            on my own, as there might be a possibility of being unable to do so
            alone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify signs of stress or overwhelm and proactively seek support
            from facilitators, mentors, or colleagues if needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Expectations from Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          I consider that the facilitation team has been extraordinary and had
          covered all my expectations from them so far. However, I will list
          them below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clear communication of course objectives, expectations, and
            assessment criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prompt feedback on assignments and projects to facilitate continuous
            improvement and understanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessible office hours or support channels for addressing
            questions, concerns, or technical difficulties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Opportunities for mentorship and guidance in navigating career
            pathways and industry trends.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scheduling information</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Block out 25-30 hours per week to work on my calendar.</li>
          <li>
            Dedicate 3-5 hours per week to do physical activity or socialize.
