        <h2>How absolute, relative, and fixed positioning differ</h2>
        <p>
          These types of positioning are like special rules we can use when
          we're telling a website how to arrange things. Each one helps us put
          things where we want them without messing up everything else on the
          page.
        </p>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3>RELATIVE</h3>
          <p>
            This is a bit like nudging a book a little to the left or right on a
            shelf without moving everything else. The book stays in its place,
            but you can adjust its position a bit. Other books on the shelf
            still stay where they are, but the one you moved might look a little
            different.
          </p>
          <p>Find an example of coding below:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              .relative-positioned { 
                position: relative; 
                top: 20px; 
                left: 20px;
              }
            </code>
          </pre>        
          <p>
            This would mean that you move the book 20px top and 20px left from
            its usual position in the bookshelf.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3>ABSOLUTE</h3>
          <p>
            It's like placing a picture frame on the wall exactly where you want
            it, regardless of where other things are. You can put it in a
            corner, in the middle, or anywhere you like, and it won't affect
            where other pictures or furniture go. It's kind of like it has its
            own special spot that doesn't bother anyone else.
          </p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              .absolute-positioned { 
                position: absolute; 
                top: 50px; 
                left: 100px;
              }
          </code></pre>
        </pre>
          <p>
            This rule would position the picture frame 50px to the top and 100px
            to the left of the wall.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept">
          <h3>FIXED</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine you have a sticker you want to put on a window. It stays in
            the same spot on the window no matter if you scroll down or move
            around the room. It's like having something stuck to the glass that
            doesn't move even if you move your head.
          </p>
          <p>An example of how to code a fixed positioning is:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              .fixed-positioned { 
                position: fixed; 
                top: 0; 
                right: 0; 
              }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            In the image below you will find a graphic example of what each
            positioning looks like on a webpage:
